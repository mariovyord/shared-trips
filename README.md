# Shared Trips

## SoftUni Exam Prep for JS Back-End 

Create an application for shared trip's plans.

The application allows visitors to browse through the shared trips catalog. Users may register with an email, password and gender which allows them to create their own trips and should be able to join trip (if the current user is not the trip creator and if seats available). Trip authors can also edit or delete their own publications at any time.
